- This dataset is called chinook0, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
- Below are questions I used to analyze the data in SQL and the answers to those queestions. 

1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
9. What are the total sales for 2009?
10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
