#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revune,product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY product;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revnue, product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product; 

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
